Full script support and the possibility of making to order can be found on my discord

the teleport script was slightly modified from the fivem.net forum, the rest of the UI was written from scratch and added to lua so that it was well selected and working
the script is inspired by the Polish MTA .DevGAMING server where I spent some time and these are not the only systems that will be released soon, so I encourage you to download
